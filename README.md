# Bug Tracker


  **A cross platform bug tracking application that allows users to add, remove, or fix defects in their product. The bugs are prioritised and categorised before being allocated to organisation members depending on their duties. The status of the bugs can be updated on a regular basis**

### ðŸ’¡ Intro
A bug tracking system can prioritize bugs and assign issues. This
helps to spot repetitive problems and concentrate on important
issues. The development team will be able to focus on high-priority
 bugs rather than wasting time on smaller issues. This improves the
team's productivity and reduces the cost of development.

So we have designed a bug tracking cross platform application, which
enables users to add, remove or resolve bugs in their software. The
bugs are prioritized and categorized and are then assigned to
members of the organization based on their roles. The status of the
bugs can be regularly updated.
